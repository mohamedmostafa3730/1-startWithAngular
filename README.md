# StartWithAngular

This project is a practice exercise for learning Angular, covering essential concepts, tools, and features.

## Concepts Used
1. **Component-Based Architecture** â€“ Building UI using reusable Angular components.
2. **Data Binding** â€“ Using interpolation, property binding, event binding, and two-way binding.
3. **Directives** â€“ Using structural (`*ngIf`, `*ngFor`) and attribute directives.
4. **Dependency Injection** â€“ Managing services and dependencies in Angular.
5. **Routing** â€“ Navigating between pages using Angular Router.
6. **Pipes** â€“ Transforming data in templates using built-in and custom pipes.
7. **Event Handling** â€“ Listening to and responding to user interactions.

## Tools Used
1. **Angular CLI** â€“ Creating components, services, and modules using command-line tools.
2. **TypeScript** â€“ Writing strongly typed JavaScript for Angular.
3. **RxJS Observables** â€“ Handling asynchronous data streams.
4. **HttpClient Module** â€“ Fetching data from APIs and communicating with the backend.
5. **Forms (Template-Driven / Reactive)** â€“ Creating and validating user input forms.
6. **CSS Framework (Bootstrap / Tailwind CSS)** â€“ Styling the UI for responsiveness.
7. **Vercel** â€“ Deploying the Angular project online.

## Features Implemented
1. **Home Page** â€“ Displaying the main content dynamically.
2. **Navigation Bar** â€“ Allowing users to move between different sections.
3. **Portfolio / Project Section** â€“ Showcasing projects using `*ngFor`.
4. **Contact Form** â€“ Implementing user input with validation.
5. **Responsive Design** â€“ Ensuring the app works on different screen sizes.

This exercise helped me build a strong foundation in Angular and its ecosystem. ðŸš€
